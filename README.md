#  As a programming enthusiast I decided to have a look into the world of go language. I have learnt the basics of go like every other language and documented the journey in this repository. The best part of this repo is that I discovered web requests and json handling in go language. And lastly my personal takeout from the journey is that in future whenever I need to implement go in my projects I can go through this repo and build things on top of that. Thank You.
